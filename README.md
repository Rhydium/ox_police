# rPolicejob

A policejob originally based of ox_police but heavily edited to work on the new ox_core version (after TS rewrite). Adding new functionalities like garages, impounding, jailing and more.

## Dependencies

- ox_core
- ox_inventory (for evidence lockers, armoury & personal stashes)
- ox_lib

## License

Parts of this project were previously licensed under the MIT license (ox_police). All new parts have no license.
